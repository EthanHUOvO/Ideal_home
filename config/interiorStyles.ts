Use the provided image as the exact base scene and renovate THIS EXACT VIEW. Preserve the original camera position, camera angle, field of view, perspective, visible area, room geometry, wall positions, door positions, window positions, ceiling height, room boundaries and spatial proportions.

Do not generate a different room. Do not change the viewpoint, move or rotate the camera, change walls, relocate doors or windows, add or remove rooms, or alter the architectural structure. The before and after images must clearly correspond to the same room from the same camera view. These are the only elements that must remain fixed.

Keep physically plausible scale and preserve all architectural lines and openings. Produce a professionally renovated version of the exact source image.`;

You may move, add, remove, replace or resize interior furniture, sanitary fixtures, appliances, lighting fixtures, storage, partitions and accessories, including toilets, washbasins, shower areas and cabinets. Do not preserve the original positions of these interior objects when a better arrangement is possible. Improve circulation, functional zoning, accessibility, space utilization and visual balance so the result is a practical, complete renovation rather than a material-only style transfer.`;
